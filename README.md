	- Its Important to name your paths well, so you don't get lost well trying to test each one.
### Lesson Learned Javascript
 	- Eyes bigger than your stomach: it's really important to know you limitation and to understand the scope of a project when you're on a time limit. This project taught to check my expectations at the door when im on a deadline.
 	- Database: understanding the relationship between entities in a database is especailly important when creating a project. Not understanding that database not only requires you to go back and refactor code, but it also waste valuable time, which can ultimately lead to a project being unfinished like this one.
 	- Planning: having a clear understanding of what you want your project to do and how it looks is fine, but you have to map out how to get there. Not having that all set up before means refactoring more code. however its also important to stick to that plan and not get side tracked.
 	- hard lessons learned: unfortunately these lessons came alittle to late. I spent most of the time troubleshooting because errors I missed on the first part of this project.
